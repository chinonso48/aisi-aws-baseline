# Purpose & Value
- **Centralized Logging:** Tamper-evident audit trail across accounts; faster investigations and detections (CloudTrail, CW Logs, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty).
- **Encryption Defaults:** Remove plaintext-at-rest risk; customer-managed KMS keys enable scoped access, rotation, and incident containment.
- **Tagging Enforcement:** Drives accountability, cost allocation, data classification; enables ABAC and policy targeting.
- **SCP Guardrails:** Org-level prevention of insecure actions; reduces drift and enforces baseline irrespective of IAM permissions.
